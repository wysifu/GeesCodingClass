            <h3>august</h3>
            <p>Students will ease into programming by first learning about the Internet and computers.</p><br>

                <h4 class="curriculum">week 1 - The Internet</h4>
                    <p><em>Daily Objective</em> - Students will start by getting familiar with what the Internet is, 
                        how it works, and all the components that are involved in creating the Internet. We will
                        use in-class time to go through the Internet crash course on <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/" target="_blank">
                        gcfglobal</a>. Each student will be expected to take notes as they go through the crash course to remember 
                        concepts later. Complete 2-3 lessons on gcfglobal with in-depth notes taken in notebook 
                    detailing interesting facts, important things to remember, key vocalbulary terms, etc.</p>

                        attempt to verbally demonstrate understanding of key concepts and topics. A multiple choice quiz will be given to monitor 
                        which concepts are being understood versus which topics may need more time and attention. Complete 2-3 lessons on gcfglobal with thorough notes taken in notebook 
                    detailing interesting facts, important things to remember, key vocalbulary terms, etc. Participate and engage with others in 
                    class discussion about the Internet; what is it ? how does it work ? how do we access the Internet ? what can we do online ? etc.</p>

                    hardware of various device types, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, and smartphones. We will use in-class time to go through the course and take 
                    notes along the way. Complete 2-3 lessons on gcfglobal with in-depth notes taken in notebook 
                    detailing interesting facts, important things to remember, key vocalbulary terms, etc.</p>

                    detailing interesting facts, important things to remember, key vocalbulary terms, etc. Participate and engage with others in 
                    class discussion about the computers themselves; which components of the computer do what, different types of computers, 
                    how do computers follow commands, etc.</p>
