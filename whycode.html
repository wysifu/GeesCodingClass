            <h2>Why Learn to Code ?</h2>

            <h4>Develop Problem Solving Skills</h4>
                <p> Programming computers will stimulate students problem solving and critical thinking skills, inevitably strenghtening them.
                    To create a program or develop websites, there are many options and different ways to accomplish the same goal. 
                    Students will use online resourses such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" 
                    target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">codeacademy</a>, <a href="https://www.py4e.com" target="_blank"
                    >python for everybody</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">youtube</a>, etc to put the pieces of the puzzle together, 
                    and solve the problem any way possible.
                </p>
            
            <h4>Combine Technical Skills and Creativity</h4>
                <p> Use your left-brain to learn a new language and use elementary to college-level logic skills at the same time. Use your right-brain to innovatively solve problems or design aesthetically pleasing
                    user interfaces. Programming computers is the perfect way to get a full-brain workout. 

                </p>
            
            <h4>Understand Computers (hardware & software)</h4>
                <p> As the world becomes increasingly more techologically aligned, it would be a great idea to be more knowledgeable about the various
                    components of computers and how they collectively work together to solve problems, run programs, connect to the internet, and even 
                    share information with other computers that are on the other side of the globe ! <br>
                </p> <br>
            
            <h4>Develop Persistence</h4>
                <p> While developing web applications for analyzing data or a digital social network, there will surely be points in the road where
                    the computer may not understand wht you are trying to say. This will result in the computer not outputting the way you thought 
                    or you will recieve error messages from the computer. These times are where the human brain is most adept to modify itself in 
                    response to experience. Between the ages of 7-25, the brain is extremely malleable, in other words this means the brain is designed
                    to be customized from experiences. The entry point to intense focus and eventually solving the problem is getting stopped, confused,
                    and borderline angry. Synapses in the students brain will be marked for change, allowing them to use the skilled they garnered from 
                    coding, such as viewing things from multiple perspectives, do not give up easy, stay open minded, teamwork and collaboration with others. <br>

            <h4>Work Remotely</h4>
                <p> As long as you have a computer and access to the Internet, you can program computers from <u><em>anywhere</em></u> in the world ! There are ways to 
                    even speak face to face through the internet while in different countries. I could type on my computer and you could watch through 
                    your screen and see the changes being made. Technology is crazy isn't it ?.. or maybe it isn't.. <br>

            <h4>High Income</h4>
                <p> Programming computers is a career field that is very hot right now due to the speed at which 21st century technology is evolving. Simply 
                    put, this means that large companies, small businesses, and individuals are <em>willing</em> to <em>pay</em> <u><em>more</em></u> than substantial anounts of money to 
                    use your computer skills. A large company may want you to create a tool for them to analyze their sales on an anual, monthly, weekly, and/or
                    daily basis. A small business may want you to create an e-commerce website for them and an individual may want you to create a robust 
                    set of instructions that only trigger one of two actions when specific conditions are met. <br>

            <h4>In-Demand Career Field</h4>
                <p>
                    Every industry uses computers. In the drive thru, the fast food company is using computers to take orders and mark them complete. The same fast food restaraunt is also 
                    using computers to calculate how much money customers owe and how much money they should get back if they pay with cash. A national bank is using a program to tell a computer 
                    that you have just purchased food from a restaraunt and the money you owe on your credit card balance should increase by 8 dollars and 63 cents.
                    Every individual person uses computers. Everyday we scroll on our phones talking to people we would not recognize if we were in the same room, and we observe videos and music through 
                    many different digital avenues, such as web applications like youtube or cloud based music storage like spotify. Whether you want to create for Fortune 500 companies or for the average
                    who loves games and movies there will surely always be a spot for a programmer to create code to tell a computer to complete a task.
