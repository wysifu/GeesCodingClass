            <h2>project-based learning</h2>
            <p> We can learn alot by reading text, watching videos, and completing courses but the best way to retain knowledge is to complete 
                projects that simulate real world situations, problems, or objectives. Most of this intro to programming class will be putting the knowledge
                learned in the online courses and in class discussion to the test during in class and individual student projects. Projects will ultimately test the students'
                resourfulness, problem solving abilities, memory, and creativity to create something with real world application. Project based learning 
                makes more of an impact because students are no longer just studying concepts, theory is being put into action by real time application.
            </p>
            <h2>individualized instruction</h2>
            <p>Individualized instruction can often lead to understanding as much as or even more than group activities can. With the use of personal whiteboards, students
                can work through problems one on one with the instructor or another student. 
            </p>
            <h2>core class integration</h2>
            <p> Core subjects will be incorporated when students are programming. In the first semester, mostly English and grammar will be 
                used in conjunction with computer programming, where students will be writing webpages on various topics. As students become more familiar with programming languages, core math and science 
                topics will be integrated. Javascipt and Python specifically has the ability to do data analysis. Science and math classes can collect data 
                and pass it to the coding class where students will intake the data and provide some sort of analysis using graphs and more.

            <h2>letter of intent</h2>
            <p class="skinny"> Hello world, I am <em>wysifu</em> and I have recently graduated (class of 2k21) from the University of New Orleans with a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies. I am interested in teaching 
                an Intro to Computer Programming class at YACS because it is imperative that students gain and train the skills needed to survive in the technology age.</p> <br> 
                
            <p class="skinny">I feel 
                that I am a good fit for this position because coming from an interdisciplinary background, I take a connected learning based approach. This approach ensures that most concepts 
                can be grasped by integrating examples from other fields of study to make new pathways of thought. Integration from other subjects will construct a better comprehension of key concepts which 
                may bring about type of freedom from rigidity or creativity that solves complex problems. I feel that I would specifically be a good teacher because I am patient and understanding with children, yet I want 
                them to be the best individuals they can be.
